# Hair Styling Simulator
_A simple **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project that simulates hair styling for an avatar using different tools like scissors, dye, and a curling iron._

## Features
_Create a custom avatar with personalized **hair color**, **texture**, **length**, and **condition**_

* Demonstrates core OOP principles:

  * **Encapsulation** (`Hair` class uses private members with setters/getters)
  * **Inheritance** (styling tools inherit from `StylingTool`)
  * **Polymorphism** (virtual `useTool` method for tools)
  * **Composition** (`Avatar` has a `Hair` object)

## Styling Tools
* **Scissors** – Cuts hair by 5 cm and improves condition
* **Dye** – Changes hair color but damages the condition
* **Curling Iron** – Makes hair curly and causes slight damage
